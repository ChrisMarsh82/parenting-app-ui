(2022). What influences individuals to invest in improved sanitation services and hygiene behaviours in a small town? A formative research study in Babati, Tanzania. PLOS ONE, 17(7), e0270688. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270688<br/>The fear of contracting diseases motivated people to practice handwashing, however, this is mostly done when there are disease outbreaks in town. Previous studies also identified fear as one of the key motives for uptalking WASH behaviour [9, 32, 33]. However, previous evidence shows that fear is a temporary stimulus to change behaviours as when fear disappears so does the behaviours too [34]. <span><b>The feeling of disgust due to the presence of dirt/dust in hands, bad smell in the latrine, protecting children and their future by washing hands (nurture) and the wish to look smart and clean also motivate individuals to wash hands.</b></span> These emotional push factors can also be exploited in promotional campaigns to promote handwashing practices.<br/><br/>Tough, H., Abdallah, A.-K., Zemp, E., & Molesworth, K.

A third of all women mentioned the health of their children as their main motivating factor for participating in the HPSS-supported CLTS initiatives",
