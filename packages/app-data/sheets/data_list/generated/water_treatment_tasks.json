High rate of drinking water contamination due to poor storage in squatter settlements in Mwanza, Tanzania. Tanzania Journal of Health Research, 20(3). <span>https://doi.org/10.4314/thrb.v20i3.7<br/></span><br/>Source of drinking water in the squatters of Mwanza city - All  households  used  tap  water  as  the  source  of  their  drinking  water.    A  total  of  157  (75.84%) respondents, reported treating their water for drinking using boiling, 119 (57.49%) leaving the water to stand and settle, 23 (11.11%) used chlorination and 15 (9.6%) strain through cloth (Table1).  The majority of households 202 (97.58%) stored their drinking water; of these 200 (98.55%) used a clay pot. Only 2 (1%) used buckets with cover and spigot as storage container of drinking water.<br/><br/>Malima, G., Mshida, H., Machunda, R., Moyo, F., Banzi, J., Gautam, O. P., Mbeguere, M., Smith, K., Cairncross, S., & Njau, K. N. (2022). What influences individuals to invest in improved sanitation services and hygiene behaviours in a small town? A formative research study in Babati, Tanzania. PLOS ONE, 17(7), e0270688. <span>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270688</span><br/>FDGs revealed several motives and barriers for households to treat water. First, <span><b>FGDs showed that fear of contracting water-borne diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea served as a motive for households to treat drinking water. </b></span>Second, the type of water source used by the household, acted as both a barrier and motive for a household to treat drinking water. Households that were collecting water from sources that are considered to be contaminated such as a river or a lake where animals also drink from, felt the need to treat water before drinking. However, households that were collecting water from the town water supply authority source (piped water), did not feel the need to treat the water because the source was considered to be clean and safe. Third, the cost of treating water (financial constraints) was another barrier. Fuel cost i.e. cost of firewood, charcoal or gas used to boil water, and cost of buying water treatment chemicals impeded households to treat drinking water.",

Always follow the instructions on the chemicals packet in order to use it safely.\n\nb) Heat can also be used treat water.  Let the water sit for sometime until the dirt settles at the bottom then pour it into a pot and boil it for at least 10 minutes to make sure all germs (pathogens) are killed before use. The water should be drunk within 24 hours .  This helps to keep it fresh and free from further germs (pathogens).  \n\nc) Sunlight can aslo be used to clean small amounts of water. Whie using this method, the bottles should be filled with pre-filtered, clear water. The bottles should then be set out in the sun (usually on rooftops) for at least 6 hours before the water is drank.",
