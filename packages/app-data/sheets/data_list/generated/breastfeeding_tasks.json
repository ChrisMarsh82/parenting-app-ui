Energy is needed!\n*  The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a baby's life.  No other food or water is needed. After six months, children should eat complementary food and continue to breasfeed until they are two and beyond.",

No bottles, teats or pacifiers should be used. \n\n* From the age of 6 months, children should begin eating safe and adequate complementary foods while continuing to breastfeed for up to 2 years and beyond.",
