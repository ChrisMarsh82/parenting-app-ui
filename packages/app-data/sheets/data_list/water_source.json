Children using these familiar sources may not realize the danger to their health or personal safety. Places to avoid include those where:\n* People are defecating in or near water sources.\n* Animals are using the same source.\n* Objects, corpses and animal carcasses have been disposed of.\n* The water source is near a damaged latrine.\n* Water is no longer treated due to dysfunctional treatment equipment.\n* There has been heavy rain or flooding, and storm-water drainage is poor.\n* Dirty surface water is entering springs and wells.",
