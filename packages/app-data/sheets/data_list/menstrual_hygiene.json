Geneva: World Health\nOrganization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2021. Licence: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO.\nMenstrual health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in relation to the menstrual cycle. Achieving menstrual health implies that women, girls and all other people who experience a menstrual cycle, throughout their life-course, are able to:\n• access accurate, timely, age-appropriate information about the menstrual cycle, menstruation and changes experienced throughout the life-course, as well as related self-care and hygiene practices.\n• care for their bodies during menstruation such that their preferences, hygiene, comfort, privacy and safety are supported. This includes accessing and using effective and affordable menstrual materials and having supportive facilities and services, including water, sanitation and hygiene services, for washing the body and hands, changing menstrual materials, and cleaning and/or disposing of used materials."

FGDs revealed that the majority of women, especially in rural areas, were using pieces of cloths during menstruation to protect themselves. Only a few respondents reported using ready-made sanitary pads."
