# Hidden vs condition

**What is the difference between the `hidden` and `condition` columns?**

_Asked on 25 May 2022_

Right now the distinction I have is to always use a condition as this does not populate any content to the page. There may be some occasions where dynamic content is not updated correctly when updating condition that do display correctly with hidden (I can't remember the exact case anymore), however these should be identified as bugs and fixed in the future.
